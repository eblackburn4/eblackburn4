# About me

I'm a current MsC Data Science student at the University of Sheffield. Before that, I worked in the UK Civil Service for 5 years in a variety of policy and analytical roles. This GitHub profile hosts repositories for the various data science projects I'm undertaking as part of my degree.

## My interests

From a technical perspective, I'm interested analysis of big datasets and the associated techniques for generating insights from them - like automated classification and prediction models using machine learning algothims, and the data mining and natural langiage processing techiques that undrpin them. 

I'm particularly passionate about applying these kinds of analysis in the context of my policymaking background in local growth - for example, in optimisation of transport networks, or the development of smart cities. I hope to explore these subject areas further upon my return to the Civil Service following my studies.

## My skills

I have domain expertise in:
- Public policymaking, particularly in the areas of local growth and urban development, and what it means to 'level up'
- Public policy evaluation, including both qualitative and quantitative methods (drawing on statistics, econometrics and social research)

I have a good working knowledge of:
- Undergraduate-level statistics
- R programming for data analysis, data visualisation and report generation

I have a basic knowledge of:
- SQL
- Python for data analysis and visualisation

## My projects

The code (and further detail on what it does) for my semester 1 final projects are in the two pinned repositories below this bio. Both projects are based around analysis of popular songs using the open-source MusicOSet database.
